# Email Wizard Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model-based assistant that helps users find answers to their email queries by retrieving relevant past emails and generating intelligent responses.

## Project Overview

This project implements an Email Wizard Assistant using RAG technology to:
1. Embed emails into vector representations
2. Retrieve relevant emails based on user queries
3. Generate coherent responses based on the retrieved emails
4. Provide a simple API interface for interaction

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-wizard-assistant.git
cd email-wizard-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/email_wizard_implementation.ipynb
```

4. Start the Flask API:
```bash
python api/app.py
```

## API Usage

### Query Email Endpoint

```
POST /query_email
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "query": "What's the status of my project?"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "response": "Based on your emails, the project is currently in the testing phase. The development team completed the core functionality last week and is now addressing minor bugs before the final release.",
  "retrieved_emails": [
    {
      "id": "email123",
      "subject": "Project Status Update",
      "snippet": "The development team has completed the core functionality..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Details

- **Embedding**: We use [model name] from Hugging Face to embed emails into vector representations.
- **Similarity Search**: We implement cosine similarity to find the most relevant emails.
- **Response Generation**: We use a RAG approach to generate coherent responses based on retrieved emails.

## Evaluation

Performance metrics:
- Average query response time: [X] ms
- Retrieval accuracy: [X]%
- Response coherence score: [X]
